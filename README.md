### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a software developer, previous competitive amateur MOBA captain (Dota 2), and 10-mile+ weekend hiker, the most important skills in my toolkit are empathy, patience, and planning. Whether itâ€™s customers or teammates, I aim to understand their perspectives, motivations, and goals to foster a space of camaraderie and growth, as well as guide the team towards achieving objectives.
